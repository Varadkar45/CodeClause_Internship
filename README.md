Allocated Project 1 : Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

Description - According to European Business Review, telecommunication providers lose close to $65 million a month from customer churn. Isn't that expensive? With many emerging telecom giants, the competition in the telecom sector is increasing and the chances of customers discontinuing a service are high. This is often referred to as Customer Churn in Telecom. Telecommunication providers that focus on quality service, lower-cost subscription plans, availability of content and features whilst creating positive customer service experiences have high chances of customer retention. The good news is that all these factors can be measured with different layers of data about billing history, subscription plans, plans, cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more to get a 360-degree view of the customer. This 360-degree view of customer data can be leveraged for predictive analytics to identify patterns and various trends that influence customer satisfaction and help reduce churn in telecom.


Allocated Project 2 :  Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm 

Description- Whenever you visit a retail supermarket, you will find that baby  diapers and wipes, bread and butter, pizza base and cheese, beer, and chips are positioned together in the store for sales. This is what market basket analysis is all about analyzing the association among products bought together by customers. Market basket analysis is a versatile use case in the retail industry that helps cross-sell products in a physical outlet and also helps e-commerce businesses recommend products to customers based on product associations. Apriori and FP growth are the most popular machine learning algorithms used for association learning to perform market basket analysis.
