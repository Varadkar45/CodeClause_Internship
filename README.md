Allocated Project 1 : Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic  Regression

Description - According to European Business Review, telecommunication providers lose close to $65 million a month from customer churn. Isn't that expensive? With many emerging telecom giants, the competition in the telecom sector is increasing and the chances of customers discontinuing a service are high. This is often referred to as Customer Churn in Telecom. Telecommunication providers that focus on quality service, lower-cost subscription plans, availability of content and features whilst creating positive customer service experiences have high chances of customer retention. The good news is that all these factors can be measured with different layers of data about billing history, subscription plans, plans, cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more to get a 360-degree view of the customer. This 360-degree view of customer data can be leveraged for predictive analytics to identify patterns and various trends that influence customer satisfaction and help reduce churn in telecom.
